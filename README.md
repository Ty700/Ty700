- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am a 4th year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and find myself doing it more than my actual coursework (oops). 
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, LUA, JavaScript, x86 Assembly, and Verilog.
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.
- [Current Project](https://github.com/Ty700/Udemy_Projects/tree/main/Hero%20vs%20Villian%20Game)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Ty700) [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/Ty700/)

Goals: 
1. Sharpen C++ skills.
     - Inheritance, Templates, Polymorphism
2. How to use C++ to form and manipulate data structures
     - BSTs, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, etc

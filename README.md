- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am a 4th year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and find myself doing it more than my actual coursework (oops). 
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, LUA, JavaScript, x86 Assembly, and Verilog.
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.
- [Current Project](https://github.com/Ty700/UTSA_embedded_systems/tree/main/morse_code_project)

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ty700
- I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and will soon be getting an Arduino Uno to make little projects that I will continue to upload the results here!
- I currently know: C, Python, C++, and LUA!
- I primarily code in C/C++ as that is the first language I learned and mostly use for my engineering projects.

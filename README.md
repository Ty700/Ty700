- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am a 4th year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and find myself doing it more than my actual coursework (oops). 
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, LUA, JavaScript, x86 Assembly, and Verilog.
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.

Self-Made Learning Path: 
1. Sharpen C++ skills.
     - Inheritance, Templates, Polymorphism
2. How to use C++ to form and manipulate data structures
     - BSTs, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, etc
3. Understand Python 
     - And why C++ is better
4. Start Machine Learning journey 
5. Dabble around in ROS Foxy 
     - Robots will take over the world D:
6. Start the adventure of front end development (JavaScript -> HTML/CSS -> React -> ?)
     - Full stack developer would be the dream, or someone who develops and maintains robots. ~~that'll destroy the world~~

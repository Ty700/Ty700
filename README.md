- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am a 4th year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and find myself doing it more than my actual coursework (oops). 
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, LUA, JavaScript, x86 Assembly, and Verilog.
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.
- [Current Project]([https://github.com/Ty700/Openssl-Password-Email](https://github.com/Ty700/CS50))

Goals: 
1. Learn how to use C to form and manipulate data structures
     - BSTs, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, etc
2. Create a robot that follows a simple object avoidance algorithm.
     - "Create" as in 3D model, build the circuitry, and program it.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ty700
- I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and will soon be getting an Arduino Uno to make little projects that I will continue to upload the results here!
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, and LUA
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.
- Current Project: None. I just finished the Simon Says game and looking for other projects to work on that are more difficult.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am an Embedded Systems Software Engineer for SwRI.
- I have experience in a bunch of different languages, but feel the best with x86 ASM, C, and (sometimes) C++.
- You'll find a catalog of different projects here that range in dates from my beginner days (funny to look at now), to my current side-projects.

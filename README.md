- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler.
- I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering major at UTSA!
- I love coding and will soon be getting an Arduino Uno to make little projects that I will continue to upload the [results](https://github.com/Ty700/7SegmentDisplay-Arudio) here!
- I currently have experience in: C, C++, Python, LUA JavaScript, and Swift.
- I primarily code in C/C++ as those are the primary languages I am learning at the moment.
- [Current Project](https://github.com/Ty700/CardGame-WIP)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Ty700) [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tylanater700/) [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/Ty700/)
- Goals (In order): 
- Understand templates, object inheritence, and streams better. 
- Better understanding of data structures algorithms like: Hash maps, BSTs, etc.
- Build a program that utilizes a GUI.
- Goodbye! Happy Problem Solving!
